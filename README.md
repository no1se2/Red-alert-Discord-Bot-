# Red alert Discord Bot/צבע אדום דיסקורד בוט
## I implemented a way to integrate the Home Front Command Alerts API with Discord to provide live, real-time alerts, hopefully saving lives.

# How to use:
### First, decide where to host the bot.
### In my case, I run it locally.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python3 redalert.py
```
### Then go to the channel where you want to receive the alerts and type !start.
